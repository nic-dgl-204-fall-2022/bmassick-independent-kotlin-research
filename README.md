# Independent Kotlin overview research - part 1

## Kotlin for Data Science
Kotlin has a lot going for it in terms of data science. Since Kotlin is concise, readable, easy to learn and is a JVM language it makes it a great choice. It has access to Java libratries and has maintainable code that is easy to troubleshoot. There are so many ways you can use Kotlin to work with data.

Kotlin also has a multitude of different interactive editors that help with dealing with data such as Jupyter Kotlin Kernal, Kotlin Notebooks in Datalore, and Zeppelin Kotlin interpreter. They are each able to offer a great deal of help with organizing and keeping track of any data you need, just in their own ways. Kotlin also has an ever expanding list of libraries for data related objectives. This list is vast and includes Java libraries.

## \[Key resources\]
### 1. Multik
Multik is a multidimensional array library. It offers idiomatic, type and dimension-safe API for mathematics to be used with the multidimensional arrays. It has 4 modules: multik-core, multik-default, multik-kotlin, and multik-openblas. Multik also supports JS. 
### 2. Lets-Plot
Lets-Plot is a plotting library for statistical data. It is offered for Kotlin and Python. It is influenced by the book "The Grammar of Graphics" by Leland Wilkinson, which by the way, after reading more of what its about I may have to purchase and read.
### 3. KotlinDL
KotlinDL is a high-level deep learning API for Kotlin. it uses a few API's such as TensorFlow and ONNX for Java. KotlinDL is aiming to make deep learning easier for JVM developers.
