# Independent Kotlin overview research - part 1

## Kotlin for Data Science
Kotlin has a lot going for it in terms of data science. Since Kotlin is concise, readable, easy to learn and is a JVM language it makes it a great choice. It has access to Java libraries and has maintainable code that is easy to troubleshoot. There are so many ways you can use Kotlin to work with data.

Kotlin also has a multitude of different interactive editors that help with dealing with data such as [Jupyter Kotlin Kernal](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter), Kotlin Notebooks in Datalore, and Zeppelin Kotlin interpreter. They are each able to offer a great deal of help with organizing and keeping track of any data you need, just in their own ways. Kotlin also has an ever expanding list of libraries for data related objectives. This list is vast and includes Java libraries.

## \[Key resources\]
### 1. [Multik](https://github.com/Kotlin/multik)
Multik is a multidimensional array library. It offers idiomatic, type and dimension-safe API for mathematics to be used with the multidimensional arrays. It has 4 modules: multik-core, multik-default, multik-kotlin, and multik-openblas. Multik also supports JS. 
### 2. [Lets-Plot](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot)
Lets-Plot is a plotting library for statistical data. It is offered for Kotlin and Python. It is influenced by the book "The Grammar of Graphics" by Leland Wilkinson, which by the way, after reading more of what its about I may have to purchase and read.
### 3. [KotlinDL](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlindl)
KotlinDL is a high-level deep learning API for Kotlin. it uses a few API's such as TensorFlow and ONNX for Java. KotlinDL is aiming to make deep learning easier for JVM developers. 
### 4. [Kravis](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kravis)
Kravis implements grammar for data visualization. This allows for an easy transition from data to graph. It is used through Jupyter and is still an experimental API. This API seems to have a lot of potential as it keeps developing.
### 5. [Smile](https://github.com/haifengl/smile)
Smile is a comprehensive learning machine developed for Java and Scala, [however it can be used with Kotlin]. Smile is an amazing API for anything to do with machine learning as it covers so many different algorithms and other advanced aspects.

Smile is a comprehensive learning machine. It is built to essentially teach AI using statistical precedures, functions and the like. This is way above my understanding on exactly how they work but this kind of thing interests me as I have wanted to try my hand at making a bot in Rocket League using some sort of machine learning. So on an extremely low level of explaination it is used when you are wanting to implement methods to train and teach your AI. This is then tracked using graphs, maps, and other scaling to show your progress on the AI. However, this is really where I start to not comprehend what is going on.

## Reflection
For the reflection I want to talk about what I learnt and what I am still confused about. So first I leanrnt that Kotlin is actually used a lot more than I thought for data science and the like. I personally have seen people mainly using Java and some Python for this. As for what I am still confused about ... well that is essentially just anything to do with machine learning. I really enjoy the idea of AI and building my own but have nowhere near the know-how to do so. It is something I plan on looking into in the future however.
